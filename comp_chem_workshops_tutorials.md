# Computational Chemistry Resources: Workshops and Tutorials

Here are a bunch of resources that might be useful for anyone who wants an introduction to comp. chem., or data science with chemistry applications. I hope to continue adding resources, but at least for now most of the resources were created by MolSSI Education- they have some really excellent workshops and tutorials. Go ahead and visit their website to learn more about what they do: http://education.molssi.org


## For an introduction to the command line/Terminal and installing software packages: https://education.molssi.org/getting-started-computational-chemistry/
Recommended for 1 year graduate students, or undergraduates with little to no experience with the command line/Terminal
- What is Comp Chem?
- What is the Terminal?
- What is a text editor?
- How to access remote computing resources
- Using Anaconda to install software
- Jupyter Notebooks

## For an introduction to Python: https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/
Recommended for 1st year graduate students, or undergraduates. 
- How to parse files for specific data
- How to write a file
- Reading and writing tabular data
- Data plotting with Matplotlib.pyplot
- Writing a Python function (Example used is how to calculate the distance between two atoms)
- Writing from the Linux command line, vs. Jupyter Notebook 
- Version control with git and keeping a project history 

## Python for data analysis and visualization: https://education.molssi.org/python-data-analysis/
Recommended for 1st year graduate students, or undergraduates with some experience with basic Bash commands (i.e., navigating the Terminal/command line) and who have introductory Python skills (i.e., know about booleans, loops, importing packages, parsing files).
- Working with Numpy arrays
- Using Pandas and dataframes
- Using Scipy for data fitting


## Quantum chemistry basics: https://education.molssi.org/qm-tools/
Recommended for 1st year graduate students, or undergraduates who have some introductory Python skills, are familiar with Matplotlib and Jupyter Notebooks. 
- Geometry optimizations
- Intra- and intermolecular potential energy surfaces
- Basis set convergence of geometry and vibrational frequencies
- Example of computing standard redox potentials
- Version control with Git and Github
- Code editing

## Brief review of elementary quantum chemistry: http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/quantrev/quantrev.html
This was created by Prof. David Sherrill at Georgia Institute of Technology. 
- Very comprehensive quantum chemistry theoretical background, maybe nice for prepping/ reviewing for your preliminary exam.

## A Hitch-Hiker's Guide to Molecular Thermodynamics (a fun text): http://alan-cooper.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hhguide.pdf
This was created by Prof. Alan Cooper at Glasgow University
- He does a great job at making thermodynamics engaging and fun to read. 

## Biomolecular Interactions (lecture slides): http://alan-cooper.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Biomol-Interactions-lecture-notes.pdf
Also created by Prof. Alan Cooper at Glasgow University
- Theoretical and experimental basis of intermolecular interactions
- Electrostatics
- Van der Waals
- Dispersion
- Hydrogen bonding
- Hydrophobic effect

## Online Eyring equation calculator: https://www.unige.ch/sciences/chiorg/lacour/correl
- First order kinetics
- Thermodynamics

## For funsies: https://www.playphrase.me/#/search
This is a website where you can type in certain words and it will find movie clips with those words. Great for adding comedic relief into group meeting slides.
